# Tekken Tier Support - Backend
철권 서포트 웹서비스 - Backend

## Overview

This project was initiated to address the irrational management of the Tekken tier list, as previously maintained on the whiteboard in the Interface Room. Our aim is to introduce objective criteria for tier changes, automating promotions and demotions based on game outcomes. By doing so, we hope to reduce emotional conflicts among club members and enhance efficiency, thereby invigorating our gaming community and fostering its growth.

## Objectives

1. **Introduce Objective Standards**: Implementing clear, unbiased criteria for tier adjustments to ensure fair and transparent ranking.

2. **Automate Tier Adjustments**: Developing a system that automatically updates tiers based on the results of the games played, minimizing manual intervention.

3. **Reduce Emotional Conflicts**: By removing subjective judgment from tier changes, we aim to decrease the potential for interpersonal issues within the club.

4. **Enhance Efficiency**: Streamlining the process of updating tiers to save time and effort, allowing members to focus more on gameplay and improvement.

5. **Foster Community Growth**: By improving the tier list system, we intend to create a more vibrant and engaging environment that encourages active participation and development within the Tekken community.
